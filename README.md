# Part 1-Starter â€” Linear scan on one sonnet

To check your implementation run the check below!

## Run the app

```bash
python -m part1.app
```

## Check against the interaction snapshot provided in the 'tests' folder

```bash
python -m part1.tests.check_transcript
```

## Where to work

Edit `part1/app.py` and implement the following two to dos:
- Implement `manual_count_occurrences` (naive manual scan, overlapping matches).
- Implement the search for the query string given by the user (details in function main)

Ensure the interaction of your app matches the snapshot (using the check above).
