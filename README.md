# Part 1 â€” Starter (Executable Spec)

To check your implementation run the check below!

## Run the app

```bash
python -m part1.app
```

## Check against the transcript (no pytest required)

```bash
python -m part1.tests.check_transcript
```

## Where to work

Edit `part1/app.py`:
- Implement `manual_count_occurrences` (naive manual scan, overlapping matches).
- Ensure the interaction matches the snapshot.
